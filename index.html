    <h6>I would argue that the concept of "warmed by the ground" is almost correct, but i think that the main point is not the interaction between the gound and the atmosphere, but, rather, the distinction between heat rate (positive in the day and negative in the night() and internal energy (temperature) of the system. Ths system keeps cooling while the heat rate is negative (night) and reached the coolest point when the heat rate becomes positive again. – Grigoris L. yesterday

        This is nitpicky; I upvoted your answer. However, with regard to your statement the lowest temperature is right at the sunrise: I suggest changing that to "the lowest temperature is typically very close to sunrise". Your own graph shows the lowest temperature occurring shortly after sunrise. In addition, there are times (e.g., a warm front that arrives in the evening) when the lowest temperature of the day occurs before sunset. – David Hammen yesterday 
        @GrigorisL. I just think the concept of flux isn't so clear to a beginner, so I said it equivalently with warming and cooling. But I couldn't say that the Sun warms the air, so I mentioned heat exchange between ground and air. – User123 yesterday
        The first two sentences seem unnecessary/out of place. What's important here is how long it has been since the sun has been shining in the surface. The time since sunset is far more impactful than the difference between whether the air is warmed directly or by the ground. – TylerH 23 hours ago

        Can this also explain why June gets the most irradiance but August is the warmest month, in many places in the northern hemisphere? – Eric Duminil 7 hours ago</h6>
